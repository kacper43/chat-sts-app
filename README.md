# ChatStsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.1.

## Development server
After cloning, run `npm install` then
run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can use your local server. To do this, you must change socket.io server URL in chat.service.ts to `http://localhost:3000`, then run `node src/backend-chat.js`.
Finally in another terminal use command `ng serve`, voila! :)
